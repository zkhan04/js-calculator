Never give up on your dreams.

I finished it! This was by far the hardest project I've completed so far, almost made me quit web development, but I'm happy I pushed through.

What I learned:
- the value of committing often and documenting changes. I had to go back to previous commits many times cause I messed something up.
- organizing code for maximum readability. By organizing my JS code into clear sections, I could easily find the piece of code I needed to edit.
- Where to use maps/objects. there were a lot of cases where I had a large if-else block that was easily cut down by wisely using a dictionary.
- The value of refactoring code and cutting down on repetition. My current system is to first implement a feature, commit, then refactor the code, commit, rinse and repeat.
  - There were a lot of hard-coded values being reused, as well as certain sets of actions I kept taking over and over again. If I didn't deal with these issues as soon as they arose, the code would be twice as long, and twice as hard to expand on.
- Generally became more comfortable with DOM manipulation, dispatching events, regexp, and getting CSS to do what I want teehee
